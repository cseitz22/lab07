### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
```

### Exercise 1

The original visualization is quite misleading. 1) There are 2 y-axes that aren't labeled, so we can't really tell which one is the average daily cases. They somewhat make it seem like the mask counties correspond to the left axis and the no-mask counties correspond to the right axis, but that seems weird because the y-axes aren't that different. 2) The x-axis is only 15-ish days worth of data, so the graph creator could've chosen a time frame that displayed that not wearing masks is better for not contracting COVID.  

```{r create-dataframe}



```

### Exercise 2

```{r make-visualization}



```


### Exercise 3

Why is this visualization better?


### Exercise 4

What does the data tell us about mask wearing and COVID?
